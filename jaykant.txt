Hello!

I am Jaykant Tiano. This file contains my project proposal.

Project:

The project will be a website that allows users to share their PC builds/setups, write descriptions, and include shopping links for the items they used. Other users will be able to rate and comment on their posts. The website will also include a forum where users can create discussions (e.g. rank the top ten builds they like, or ask advices for the gaming rig they are currently building).

This project will have four main entities (more might be added):
* Users
* Builds
* Posts
* Comments
